Welcome to the Contributor Manual for the [Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD)](https://lingconlab.ru/tald)!

Here you will find basic instructions for collecting 
a [feature dataset](datasets.html) for the Atlas, writing and formatting
an accompanying [chapter](chapters.html), and creating [map visualizations](maps.html).

See the [step-by step](steps.html) instructions for a short summary of the workflow.
