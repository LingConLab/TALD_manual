Welcome to the Contributor Manual for the [Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD)](http://lingconlab.ru/dagatlas/)!

Here you will find basic instructions for collecting 
a [feature dataset](datasets.html) for the Atlas, writing and formatting
an accompanying [chapter](chapters.html), and creating [map visualizations](maps.html).

The manual also introduces the underlying [philosophy](https://lingconlab.github.io/TALD_manual/philosophy.html) of
the project and the structure of the data.

See the [step-by step](steps.html) instructions for a short summary of the workflow.
