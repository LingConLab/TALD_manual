<!-- - Gives a general characterization of how it is expressed cross-linguistically -->
<!-- - If applicable: describes how the classification in [TALD](http://lingconlab.ru/dagatlas) differs from [WALS](http://wals.info) (e.g. our chapter on the [Standard of Comparison](http://lingconlab.ru/dagatlas/standard_of_comparison.html) shows more sub-types of spatial comparatives) -->
<!-- - Describes the goal of the text / map in one sentence: "Our goal is to classify the languages of Daghestan according to the type of spatial form used to mark the standard of comparison." -->


## Results

<!-- - Summarizes the different types/values you discovered; types identified in the text should correspond to values shown on the map. If you want to fuse multiple types into one category, be sure to explain this decision in the text. Here you can add as many chapter-specific subsections as you like. -->
<!-- - Provide examples -->
<!-- - Identify which types are more or less common -->


## Distribution

<!-- - Describe the distribution with links to the appropriate maps on the data and maps page. The number of the map corresponds to the number of the value, see [Map 1](). The URL will be added later (between the brackets). Does the distribution of different types show a genealogical and / or areal signal? -->
