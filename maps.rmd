Maps in [TALD](https://lingconlab.ru/tald) are generated automatically based on the **value** columns. <br>
As explained in [Feature datasets](datasets.html), you can have multiple value columns in order to generate different maps. You can use both nominal and numeric values.

> Keep in mind that a large number of values is difficult to perceive, do not use more than 5 values on one map.

If you want, you can experiment with map visualizations by yourself using the `lingtypology` package for R. <br>
You can find a detailed tutorial for the package [here](https://ropensci.github.io/lingtypology/).

A sample code for experimenting with TALD visualizations as well as the necessary metadata such as village coordinates can be found [here](map_tutorial/).
